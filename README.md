# Wild-Weather-Dashboard



## Description

This project is a weather dashboard that allows users to search for a specific city and view current and future weather conditions for that city. The dashboard includes form inputs for searching for a city, and when a city is searched, the user is presented with the current weather conditions, including the city name, date, weather conditions icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The user can also view a 5-day forecast for the city, which includes the date, weather conditions icon, temperature, and humidity.
